      <description>Welcome to the second part of our series of articles on Basic Reverse Engineering! Link to heading ██ ██ █████ ██████ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ███ █████ ███████ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ █████ ██████ Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve explored the fundamental concepts of CPU in the first article, it&amp;rsquo;s time to understand how data is represented and manipulated internally by computers. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about numbering systems, with a focus on hexadecimal, which is crucial for those working with low-level reverse engineering.</description>

      <description>This series of articles covers basic low-level concepts in computers, with a specific focus on exploring binaries and reverse engineering. Some points may seem confusing at first, but remember: everything follows a definition. Don’t get stuck in an endless loop of &amp;ldquo;why!?!&amp;rdquo; — just understand each concept and its purpose. You will use these concepts in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and even malware development in the future.&#xA;What is a CPU?</description>
