      <description>Welcome to the second part of our series of articles on Basic Reverse Engineering! Link to heading ██ ██ █████ ██████ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ███ █████ ███████ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ ██ █████ ██████ Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve explored the fundamental concepts of CPU in the first article, it&amp;rsquo;s time to understand how data is represented and manipulated internally by computers. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about numbering systems, with a focus on hexadecimal, which is crucial for those working with low-level reverse engineering.</description>

      <title>Review of assembly</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/assembly-review/</link>

      <description>What is assembly? Link to heading Assembly is a low-level programming language, it is written to communicate directly with the processor hardware. Unlike high-level languages, such as the famous Python, assembly operates close to machine code, the famous binary! Each assembly instruction generally represents a single CPU operation, such as moving data between registers, performing arithmetic operations or controlling the flow of execution.&#xA;Assembly is not universal!! It depends directly on the processor architecture.</description>

      <description>This series of articles covers basic low-level concepts in computers, with a specific focus on exploring binaries and reverse engineering. Some points may seem confusing at first, but remember: everything follows a definition. Don’t get stuck in an endless loop of &amp;ldquo;why!?!&amp;rdquo; — just understand each concept and its purpose. You will use these concepts in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and even malware development in the future.&#xA;What is a CPU?</description>

      <title>Privilege Escalation in Linux</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/privesc-linux/</link>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Slayer. In this paper, I will talk about privilege escalation in Linux. I recommend that, while reading this paper, also go testing the techniques in practice, as this will help to better understand the concepts and apply the knowledge acquired more effectively.&#xA;Introduction Link to heading Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher levels of access or control on a system than originally allowed. On Linux systems, this often involves elevating a common user to root privileges or exploiting poorly configured permissions to access restricted resources.</description>

      <description>https://tryhackme.com/room/dragonbyte&#xA;In this paper, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you step by step through the Dragon Byte room, made by brother NullByte! From recon to root!&#xA;Reconnaissance Link to heading After starting the machine and obtaining the IP, the first thing we have to do is port scanning. In this CTF I used the RustScan tool to do the port scanning:&#xA;This scan revealed that we have 3 open ports, namely:</description>

      <title>Rootkits in Firmware</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/rootkits-firmware/</link>

      <guid>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/rootkits-firmware/</guid>
      <description>What is a Rootkit? Link to heading A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain and maintain privileged access to a system while hiding its presence. The term comes from the combination of &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo;, which refers to the user with maximum privileges on Linux systems, and &amp;ldquo;kit&amp;rdquo; which represents a set of tools used to control the compromised system&#xA;The main purpose of a rootkit is to ensure persistence, allowing an attacker to continue accessing the system even after reboots or removal attempts.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites: Requirements for the users that are planning to learn Malware Development are first of all basics of programming, since mostly deals with the C programming lanaguage, it is a requirement that you are familiar with fundamentals of C.&#xA;So what is actually Windows Architecture? It is what happens under the hood of Windows processes and applications, the internal structure of the Windows operating system, envolves layers like hardware, kernel, executive services, and subsystem DLLs.</description>

      <title>buffer overflow in practice</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/bof/</link>

      <description>What is buffer overflow? Link to heading Buffer overflow (BOF) is one of the most wellknown and historically significant vulnerabilities in the world of cybersecurity. It occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing memory corruption. This flaw can be exploited by pentesters to execute arbitrary code, modify program behavior, or cause a crash.&#xA;Despite the introduction of modern security mechanisms such as ASLR and stack canaries, buffer overflow remains a critical topic in exploit development and pentesting.</description>
