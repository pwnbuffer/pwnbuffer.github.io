      <description>lights off &amp;amp; black0ut on&#xA;1- Introduction Link to heading Hello, Welcome!!!&#xA;In this article, I will discuss how modern protections in the Linux Kernel hinder and mitigate rootkit functionalities, and of course, how to bypass them.&#xA;2- Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) Link to heading As one of the primary defense mechanisms of the Kernel and other systems, it randomizes the kernel&amp;rsquo;s memory addresses on each boot, making exploitation more difficult for attackers.</description>

      <title>x86 Part. 1 — CPU</title>

      <description>This series of articles covers basic low-level concepts in computers, with a specific focus on exploring binaries and reverse engineering. Some points may seem confusing at first, but remember: everything follows a definition. Don’t get stuck in an endless loop of &amp;ldquo;why!?!&amp;rdquo; — just understand each concept and its purpose. You will use these concepts in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and even malware development in the future.&#xA;What is a CPU?</description>

      <description>1. Introduction Link to heading EDR solutions a.k.a (Endpoint Detection and Response) are an evolution of the security software we know as antivirus. Modern EDRs use advanced techniques to detect threats, hooking APIs, isolating the host from the internet, analyzing behavior, and classifying detections based on Indicator of Compromise (IOC) rules classified by MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK.&#xA;In this article, I will demonstrate how to bypass EDRs using evasive techniques.&#xA;2. Technical Analysis Link to heading In a real attack, it is common to use &amp;ldquo;Loaders&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Droppers&amp;rdquo; that load the main malware, going through stages.</description>

      <title>Privilege Escalation in Linux</title>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Slayer. In this paper, I will talk about privilege escalation in Linux. I recommend that, while reading this paper, also go testing the techniques in practice, as this will help to better understand the concepts and apply the knowledge acquired more effectively.&#xA;Introduction Link to heading Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher levels of access or control on a system than originally allowed. On Linux systems, this often involves elevating a common user to root privileges or exploiting poorly configured permissions to access restricted resources.</description>

      <description>1. introduction Link to heading Active Directory (AD) is a tool for network administrators, enabling the creation and management of domains, users and objects within a corporate network. Through AD, it is possible to connect all machines to a DC (Domain Controler) server. to a DC (Domain Controler) server which authenticates users using the kerberos protocol.&#xA;For example, an administrator can create a group of users within the corp.local domain and grant them specific privileges to access folders or internal systems.</description>

      <description>https://tryhackme.com/room/dragonbyte&#xA;In this paper, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you step by step through the Dragon Byte room, made by brother NullByte! From recon to root!&#xA;Reconnaissance Link to heading After starting the machine and obtaining the IP, the first thing we have to do is port scanning. In this CTF I used the RustScan tool to do the port scanning:&#xA;This scan revealed that we have 3 open ports, namely:</description>

      <title>Rootkits in Firmware</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/rootkits-firmware/</link>

      <description>What is a Rootkit? Link to heading A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain and maintain privileged access to a system while hiding its presence. The term comes from the combination of &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo;, which refers to the user with maximum privileges on Linux systems, and &amp;ldquo;kit&amp;rdquo; which represents a set of tools used to control the compromised system&#xA;The main purpose of a rootkit is to ensure persistence, allowing an attacker to continue accessing the system even after reboots or removal attempts.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites: Requirements for the users that are planning to learn Malware Development are first of all basics of programming, since mostly deals with the C programming lanaguage, it is a requirement that you are familiar with fundamentals of C.&#xA;So what is actually Windows Architecture? It is what happens under the hood of Windows processes and applications, the internal structure of the Windows operating system, envolves layers like hardware, kernel, executive services, and subsystem DLLs.</description>

      <title>buffer overflow in practice</title>
      <link>https://pwnbuffer.org/en/posts/slayer/bof/</link>

      <description>What is buffer overflow? Link to heading Buffer overflow (BOF) is one of the most wellknown and historically significant vulnerabilities in the world of cybersecurity. It occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing memory corruption. This flaw can be exploited by pentesters to execute arbitrary code, modify program behavior, or cause a crash.&#xA;Despite the introduction of modern security mechanisms such as ASLR and stack canaries, buffer overflow remains a critical topic in exploit development and pentesting.</description>
