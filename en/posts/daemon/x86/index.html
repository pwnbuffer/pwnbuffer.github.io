<p>The <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> (CPU) is the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of a computer, responsible for processing information and managing data stored in memory. It performs essential functions such as processing, storage, and input/output operations, making it crucial for the functioning of computer systems, including operating systems, mobile devices, and embedded systems.</p>
<p>A computer, in a simplified way, can be seen as a set of instructions stored in memory that are processed by the CPU. The basic architecture of a computer consists of three main components: the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, all connected through a bus (<em>BUS</em>) <strong>(see the image above)</strong>.</p>
<p>The foundation of this architecture was proposed by <strong>John Von Neumann</strong>, whose concepts still influence the design of modern processors. However, contemporary CPUs often do not strictly follow Von Neumann’s original architecture, although many of its principles remain fundamental. Additionally, CPUs may adopt different internal management models, such as <strong>CISC</strong> (Complex Instruction Set Computing) and <strong>RISC</strong> (Reduced Instruction Set Computing), which will be explained later.</p>

<p><strong>Registers</strong> are internal storage areas of the CPU, designed to process data quickly. Unlike RAM, where data stays for a longer period, data in registers is temporary and used in high-speed operations. Before being processed, all data must be stored in a register. (This concept will be better understood when we cover Assembly language).</p>

<p>The <strong>ALU</strong> (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is responsible for performing arithmetic calculations (such as addition and subtraction) and logical operations (such as AND, OR, NOT) that have been decoded by the <strong>Control Unit</strong> (CU).</p>
<p>Some of the most common processes executed by the ALU include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition</li>

<p><strong>RAM</strong> (Random Access Memory) is a volatile memory that stores temporary data while the system is running. It organizes this data in sequences of bytes, with each byte having a unique address used for quick access. The amount of available RAM determines the physical memory of a device or computer. Currently, RAM capacities can range from gigabytes (GB) and are used to store temporary data, such as the operating system and specific areas for <strong>buffers</strong> and <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> devices.</p>
<p>The image below illustrates how a 16 GB RAM operates in a modern system:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://pwnbuffer.org/images/daemon/x86/memory.png" alt="memory">
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free:</strong> Refers to the memory spaces available for the operating system and for managing running processes.<br>
The other memory spaces are used for hardware management, <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> operations, and the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, physical memory is not accessed directly by processes. Instead, it is mapped through <strong>address spaces</strong> and <strong>virtual memory</strong>, allowing the operating system to manage and allocate memory efficiently, isolating processes and maximizing the use of available resources.</p>

<p><strong>External storage devices</strong> are <strong>non-volatile</strong> memories, meaning they retain data even when the system is turned off. They offer much larger storage capacities compared to <strong>RAM</strong>, but, in contrast, tend to be slower in terms of access speed. These devices are used to store large volumes of data permanently, such as files, programs, and operating systems.</p>

<p><strong>Ports</strong> are the physical or logical access points that allow peripherals to be connected to the computer. Devices such as printers, keyboards, mice, and other accessories are connected through these ports. <strong>Drivers</strong> are specific programs that manage communication between the operating system and the peripherals, controlling how these devices are handled and interacting with the computer.</p>

<p>The <strong>bus</strong> is a set of physical or logical pathways in a system that allows data transfer between the different components of the computer. It facilitates communication between the <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>memory</strong>, and <strong>peripherals</strong>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://pwnbuffer.org/images/daemon/x86/bus.jpg" alt="bus">
</div>
<p>The three main types of lines in a bus are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control line:</strong> Responsible for managing control and synchronization operations between components.</li>
<li><strong>Address line:</strong> Carries memory or device addresses to specify where data should be read or written.</li>
<li><strong>Data line:</strong> Transfers the actual data between components.</li>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>When we open a program, it is loaded into the computer’s memory. A program is simply a set of instructions in <strong>machine code</strong> that the CPU must execute.</p>
<p>In a 32-bit CPU (like the x86 architecture), it reads small blocks of data called <em>doublewords</em> (which are 4 bytes or 32 bits). When it encounters an address in memory, the CPU takes that data block and temporarily stores it in one of its registers, which are like quick drawers. Then, the CPU reads the content of this data and executes the instruction contained within.</p>
<p>After executing each instruction, the CPU fetches the next instruction from memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CPU has a register called the <strong>Instruction Pointer</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>), or <strong>EIP</strong> (Extended Instruction Pointer) / <strong>RIP</strong> (Register Instruction Pointer), which points to the address of the next instruction to be executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This register can be manipulated, altering the flow of the program. This is exploited by <strong>malwares</strong> to modify the system&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

<p>CISC (<strong>Complex Instruction Set Computer</strong>) is a processor architecture that prioritizes powerful instructions with multiple steps or functionalities. It was designed to minimize the number of instructions the programmer needs to write by offering commands with various functionalities. This architecture is very common in personal computers and servers, being used by companies like Intel and AMD.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Complex and multi-step instructions</strong>: Many CISC instructions perform multiple operations at once, reducing the number of instructions needed, but it also decreases the operation speed.</li>
<li><strong>Variable instruction lengths</strong>: Instructions can be of different sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Direct memory access</strong>: CISC instructions can access memory directly, which simplifies programming, but increases data access time.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced addressing modes</strong>: CISC has many forms of addressing, resulting in flexibility to manage data structures&hellip;</li>

<li><strong>eax</strong>: This is the destination register, meaning the place where the data will be copied.</li>
<li><strong>[ebx]</strong>: This indicates the <strong>source operand</strong>. The brackets around <code>ebx</code> indicate that the value being accessed is not directly in the <code>ebx</code> register, but at the <strong>memory address</strong> stored in the <code>ebx</code> register. In other words, <code>ebx</code> contains a memory address, and the value at that address will be moved to the <code>eax</code> register.</li>

<p>RISC (<strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</strong>) is a processor architecture/design focused on simplicity and speed. In RISC architectures like <strong>ARM</strong> and <strong>RISC-V</strong>, instructions are designed to be executed in a single clock cycle, which increases execution speed and reduces power consumption. This makes RISC ideal for mobile devices, embedded systems, and efficient computing.</p>

<li><strong>Simple single-cycle instructions</strong>: RISC instructions are simple, allowing for fast execution.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed-length instructions</strong>: Instructions have a fixed length, reducing decoding complexity, which results in increased execution speed.</li>
<li><strong>Load/store architecture</strong>: RISC separates memory access and computation. It requires that data be loaded into registers first, and then operated on. This means that before performing any <strong>arithmetic or logical operation</strong> on data, the data <strong>must first be loaded (load) into a register</strong>. After manipulation, the result <strong>can be stored (store) back into memory</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Limited addressing modes</strong>: RISC has fewer addressing instructions, which reduces complexity. However, this requires additional instructions for more complex operations.</li>

<p>The <strong>x86</strong> architecture originated with the <strong>8086</strong> microprocessor, developed by Intel. Due to its success, the company expanded the line, releasing new models such as <strong>80186, 80286, 80386</strong>, and so on.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://pwnbuffer.org/images/daemon/x86/gen.png" alt="intel-gen">
</div>
<p>Initially, the naming followed the <strong>80x86</strong> standard, where the &ldquo;x&rdquo; represented a variable number. Over time, for simplification, the name was shortened to <strong>x86</strong>, becoming the widely used term to this day. With the evolution of technology, the x86 architecture received various improvements and extensions, always preserving compatibility with previous generations. This principle allowed older software to continue running on more modern processors, ensuring a smooth transition between different hardware generations.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes came with <strong>AMD</strong>, which developed the <strong>x86-64</strong> architecture, introducing support for <strong>64-bit</strong>. This innovation allowed for greater processing power and support for more RAM, marking a significant advance in high-performance computing.</p>
<p>Although Intel initially invested in its own 64-bit architecture, called <strong>IA-64</strong> (used in the Itanium line), it eventually adopted AMD&rsquo;s <strong>x86-64</strong> standard. This ensured that processors from both companies were compatible and followed the same instruction set, promoting a joint evolution of the architecture.</p>
<p>Today, Intel and AMD continue to advance the <strong>x86-64</strong> architecture, incorporating new technologies, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing performance, while always maintaining compatibility.</p>
